NESTER SERVICE TERMS\n\n### 1.    Introduction\n\n1.1     These terms and conditions (“Service Terms”) govern the use by you (“Client”, “you”, “your”) of the peer-to-peer finance service operated by Nester Platform Limited, whose details are set out in Clause 2.9 (“Nester”, “we”, “us” and “our”) via https://nester.com, (the “Service”) where your application to use the Service is approved by us.\n\n1.2          By accepting these Service Terms you also agree to:\n\n(a)        our privacy policy at https://nester.com/privacy-policy (“Privacy Policy”);\n\n(b)        the investors’ risk statement at https://nester.com/risk (“Risk Statement”);\n\n(c)        our conflicts policy at https://nester.com/conflict-policy (“Conflicts Policy”); and\n\n(d)        the terms of the Payment Services Agreement and related privacy policy between you and the Payment Services Provider (“as defined in Clause 2.9”);\n\nThe Service Terms take effect when accepted by you and we have notified you that your application to use the Service has been approved, and shall continue thereafter unless and until they are terminated under Clause 16.\n\nNote: Cancellation of these Service Terms\n\nIf you are an Investor who, for the purpose entering into these Service Terms, makes exclusive use of one or more means of distance communications up to and including the time at which these Service Terms are entered into, you shall be entitled to cancel these Service Terms within the 14 day period that begins on the day after you enter into it (“Statutory Cancellation Period”). However, in the event that you make an Offer under Clause 4 of these Service Terms during the Statutory Cancellation Period, you will no longer be able to cancel these Service Terms (or that Offer). You may exercise your right of cancellation by emailing us to that effect at compliance@nester.com.\n\n2.   The Service\n2.1          Subject to the provisions of these Service Terms, the Service enables each Client who we register to make funds available (“Investor”) to make an offer of Sharia-compliant credit under Clause 4 (“Offer”) to any Client we register and allow to make a Finance Request under Clause 5 (“Buyer”). The resulting finance is by way of the back-to-back purchase and sale of a specific quantity of a commonly traded commodity (“Commodity”), so that the Buyer’s total funding requirement is met from multiple Investors on certain deferred payment terms under a separate murabaha contract for each £1,000 being invested (“Murabaha Contract”). Each Murabaha Contract is subject to a standard set of finance terms and conditions (“Murabaha Conditions”) which each Investor must read and agree before making an Offer and each Buyer must read and agree before making a Finance Request. We also provide the Buyer with a summary of all the Murabaha Contracts it enters into at or about the same time (“Murabaha Contract Summary”), which is used by us to administer all the relevant Murabaha Contracts in the same way.\n\n2.2          In accordance with the terms of each Murabaha Contract, on the Start Date and each subsequent Payment Date, Nester Security Trustee Ltd, whose details are in Clause 2.9 (“the Security Trustee”) acting as trustee for and on behalf of the Investor, purchases the Commodity from a third party broker (“Selling Broker”) at the spot market price (“Cost Price”). The Investor then immediately sells the Investor’s right, title and interest in the Commodity to the Buyer at a price that includes a profit element (“Profit”) and all applicable Fees (“Murabaha Price”), and the Security Trustee shall then hold the legal title to the Commodity as trustee for and on behalf of the Buyer; and the Security Trustee then immediately sells the Commodity to a third party broker (“Buying Broker”) at the Cost Price. The perpetuity period of each of the respective trusts arising under this Clause 2.2 shall be 125 years.\n\n2.3          Both the Investor and the Buyer respectively consent to, and authorise, the Security Trustee to make the initial purchase of the Commodity from the Selling Broker, and ultimate sale of the Commodity to the Buying Broker, on the commodity trading platform (“Commodity Trading Platform”) operated by DDCAP Limited, whose details are in Clause 2.11 (“Commodity Platform Operator”) under the then current standard terms and conditions applicable to such trades from time to time at <insert url> (“Commodity Sale Terms”).\n\n2.4          The Investor may invest in each Murabaha Contract as either the initial Investor; or by replacing the then current Investor (“Outgoing Investor”) in accordance with the novation process specified in Clauses 6.7 to 6.9 of these Service Terms.\n\n2.5          In addition to each Murabaha Contract, a Buyer and any other grantor of security must enter into certain security documents (each a “Security Document”) with the Security Trustee, under Clause 5.10(a) to secure the payment obligations of the Buyer under the Murabaha Contracts entered into by that Buyer. The Security Document(s) in relation to each Buyer will be held in trust by the Security Trustee in accordance with the provisions of Clause 5.10 for the benefit of each Investor to which the Buyer is indebted under Murabaha Contracts. The Security Trustee shall also act in accordance with any written instructions given to the Security Trustee at any time by Nester as part of arrangements (a) the purpose of which is to compensate an Investor when a Buyer fails to pay any sum due to that Investor under a relevant Murabaha Contract or (b) which form a necessary part of our regulated activities in operating the Service; or as otherwise agreed in the Murabaha Contract(s) with the Buyer. All Investors agree that any such instructions given to the Security Trustee will be binding on all Investors and shall not give rise to any liability to such Investors for any losses (including loss of profit), claims, demands, actions, proceedings, damages and other payments, costs, expenses and other liabilities of any kind resulting from any such instructions (except in the event of gross negligence, wilful misconduct or fraud).\n\n2.6          While the Service is designed to match Investors and Buyers in accordance with these Service Terms, we do not undertake to find Finance Requests, Offers, Murabaha Contracts, Investors or Buyers for you (as the case may be).\n\n2.7          If and when we offer the ability to invest in Murabaha Contracts through a Nester Innovative Finance Individual Savings Account(“Nester IFISA”)in accordance with Clause 8, it will be managed by the IFISA Manager (as defined in Clause 2.9) and your money will be held in a client money account operated by the IFISA Manager(your “IFISA Account”).\n\n2.8        We, the Security Trustee, the Payment Service Provider, the IFISA Manager and the Commodity Platform Operator do not warrant or represent that:\n\n(a)        the use of any document(s) supplied as part of the Service, including these Service Terms and the documents referred to in or provided under them, are suitable or appropriate for you or any person entering into a Security Document, or your or their requirements, and you and they must take independent legal and other advice on the terms of such documents;\n\n(b)        any expected bad debt estimates supplied on the Service are accurate or reliable.\n\n2.9        The regulatory details of Nester, the Security Trustee, the IFISA Manager, the Payment Service Provider and the Commodity Platform Operator are:\n\n(a)        Nester Platform Limited is authorised and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority, and entered on the Financial Services Register under firm registration number 915346; it is incorporated in England and Wales (company number 12097430), with its registered office at 20-22 Wenlock Road, London N1 7GU; and registered with the Office of the Information Commissioner (registration number ZA573383).\n\n(b)        Security Trustee: Nester Security Trustee Ltd is incorporated in England and Wales (company number 12536813), with its registered office at 20-22 Wenlock Road, London N1 7GU; and registered with the Office of the Information Commissioner (registration number ZA756742);\n\n(c)        IFISA Manager and Payment Agent: Goji Financial Services Limited is a company incorporated in England and Wales under company number 10234133 with its registered office at 133 Whitechapel High Street, London, E1 7QA and:\n\n(i)        is authorised and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority under firm reference number 805323;\n\n(ii)       is approved as an ISA manager by HMRC.\n\n(d)        Payment Service Provider: Modulr FS Limited, a company incorporated in England and Wales under company number 09897919 and Modulr Finance Limited, a company incorporated in England and Wales under company number 09897957, both having their registered office at One Hammersmith Broadway, London W6 9DL; Modulr FS Limited is authorised by the Financial Conduct Authority under the Electronic Money Regulations 2011 (reference number 900573) for the issuing of electronic money; and both Modulr Finance Limited and Goji Financial Services Limited, are registered agents of Modulr FS Limited for the purpose of providing the payment services under the Payment Services Agreement in relation to the Service.\n\n(e)        Commodity Platform Operator: DD&CO Limited is incorporated in England and Wales (company number 00228785), with its registered office at 8-10 Grosvenor Gardens London SW1W 0DH United Kingdom.\n\n3.

Your Nester Account does not hold any funds, but is used to record transactions and other information, including a list of your respective Investors or respective Buyers (as the case may be), amounts paid by you or owed to you, but does not hold any funds.

If you attempt to become both an Investor and a Buyer at any time we will regard that as a fundamental breach of these Service Terms and we may terminate these Service Terms and close your Nester Account with immediate effect as set out at Clause 16.\n\n3.10          Each time you seek to access your Nester Account, we will check your identity by asking for your Security Codes.  As long as your correct Security Codes are entered, we will assume that you are the person giving instructions and you will be liable for them, except to the extent provided for in Clause 3.11.  You must therefore keep the Security Codes secret and make sure that they are not stored in a way that enables others to access them or impersonate you.  In addition, if you disclose the Security Codes to any person whom you authorise to access your Nester Account, you are also responsible and liable for any access, use, misuse or disclosure of your Security Codes or your Nester Account by such person.\n\n3.11        Unless and until you tell us that you believe that someone acting without your authority knows the Security Codes or can use the Service by impersonating you:\n\n(a)        you will be responsible for any instruction which we receive and act on, even if it was not given by you; and\n\n(b)        we will not be responsible for any unauthorised access to confidential Information about you in your Nester Account.\n\nWe can refuse to act on any instruction that we believe: (i) was unclear; or (ii) was not given by you or someone acting on your behalf with your authority; or (iii) might cause us to breach a legal or other duty; or (iv) if we believe the Service is being used for an illegal purpose.\n\n3.12        You acknowledge and agree that you are responsible for transactions associated with your Nester Account, your Payment Accounts and your IFISA Account (if you have one).

Making an Offer – General\n4.1          You may make an Offer to enter into a Murabaha Contract via the Service in response to either a Finance Request or another Investor’s request to novate an existing Murabaha Contract on the terms specified in Clauses 6.7 to 6.9 by following the instructions in your Nester Account and the provisions of these Service Terms.\n\n4.2          You should consider carefully these Service Terms, including the Risk Statement, before making an Offer.

The Security Trustee will hold the Security Document(s) and rights and interests created by the Security Document(s) in trust for the benefit of all the relevant Investors to that Buyer from time to time, and will enforce the Security Documents for the benefit of such Investors in accordance with Clause 6.5. The perpetuity period of that trust shall be 125 years.\n\n(h)        you acknowledge that you have read and understood the Finance Request and the Due Diligence Material in relation to which you are making the Offer, including Risk Statement and the Murabaha Contract;\n\n(i)         you acknowledge and agree that our decision to allow the relevant Buyer to publish the Finance Request does not constitute any approval or endorsement of the Finance Request or any representation by us or the Security Trustee that the Due Diligence Material accurately reflects the risks associated with the Finance Request; and further that you accept and agree that none of we, the Security Trustee or the Commodity Platform Operator warrants or represents  that use of any of the documents supplied as part of the Service including, without limitation to the generality of the foregoing, those relating to the Murabaha Contract are suitable or appropriate for your needs and you must take your own independent legal and other advice on the terms of such documents; and\n\n(j)         you acknowledge that expected bad debt estimates are estimates for general guidance only and neither Nester nor the Security Trustee warrants their accuracy, timeliness or reliability.\n\n4.5          We reserve the right to reject an Offer for any reason, or no reason, at any time.\n\n4.6          When you make an Offer, the amount specified in that Offer (the “Offer Amount”) will immediately be shown as reserved in your Nester Account and will not be available to be allocated to other Offers or to be withdrawn from our Payment Account or your IFISA Account (as relevant) for a period ending on the earlier of the date on which:\n\n(a)        the required funding specified in the relevant Finance Request is achieved and subsequent acceptance process is completed under Clause 5.10(a); or\n\n(b)        the relevant Finance Request fails to attract the required funding within the time specified in the Finance Request; or\n\n(c)        the relevant Murabaha Contract(s) matching your Offer is (are) novated; or\n\n(d)        the relevant Finance Request is withdrawn or is otherwise terminated in accordance with these Service Terms.\n\n4.7          If the Finance Request target funding level is not met or the Finance Request is withdrawn in accordance with the terms of these Service Terms, the Offer Amount will no longer be reserved in your Nester Account and you as an Investor will be free to allocate that amount to another Offer.\n\n4.8          We shall not be responsible for the suitability of any Offer or Finance Request for you or any purpose for which you make any Offer. You should consider carefully the terms of the Risk Statement before making an Offer.\n\n4.9          The relevant Offers matching the relevant Finance Request will be accepted by Buyers in accordance with Clause 5.10(a) in the order in which they are entered on the Service, provided that we may deem an Offer to be void for any reason, or no reason, at any time whatsoever in our absolute discretion (which we may not be able to explain where prohibited from doing so under Applicable Law).\n\n4.10        There will not be a statutory right to cancel any Offers made under these Service Terms.\n\n5.

and\n(b)        We and the Security Trustee will carry out certain due diligence specified below on each Finance Request (“Due Diligence”) and make the resulting Information, and any other Information the Security Trustee reasonably deems necessary, available for each prospective Investor to view in a specific area of the Service for the purpose of considering whether or not to make an Offer, including:\n\n(i)         the Finance Request, sample Murabaha Contract and the Murabaha Conditions;\n\n(ii)        full and exact details of the Commodity, including the specification of the quality, quantity and location thereof;\n\n(iii)       the terms and conditions relating to the purchase and sale of the Commodity on the Commodity Trading Platform; and\n\n(iv)       certain Information about the Property, including the Valuation, lease(s), tenant(s) and their covenants, the Certificate of Title, the result of any review of the Certificate of Title carried out by the solicitors acting for the Security Trustee, the details of any Title Insurance;\n\n(v)        Information relating to any building project related to the property, including any certificate issued by the Project Monitoring Surveyor;\n\n(vi)       the Security Document(s) and Information about any other party entering into Security Document(s), including identity and credit reference checks.\n\n5.8          Once the Due Diligence is completed to the Security Trustee’s satisfaction:\n\n(a)        you will be notified by the Security Trustee who will send you the final version of the Security Documents for you to review in consultation with your own independent legal adviser;\n\n(b)        we will be notified by the Security Trustee, in which case we will notify you that you may post your Finance Request on the Service.\n\n5.9          By publishing your Finance Request on the Service, you agree that:\n\n(a)        subject to Clause 5.10 and the satisfaction of any conditions precedent stated in the Murabaha Contract (“Special Conditions”), the acceptance by you of each Investor’s Offer will create a direct Murabaha Contract between you and each Investor, governed by the Murabaha Conditions under which you buy the Investor’s right, title and interest in the Commodity, whereupon the Security Trustee shall then hold the legal title to the Commodity as trustee for and on behalf of the Buyer, pending sale to the Buying Broker (and the perpetuity period of that trust shall be 125 years);\n\n(b)        you agree to the Security Trustee, acting as trustee for and on your behalf for the purposes of immediately selling your right title and interest in the Commodity to the Buying Broker as contemplated by the terms of the Murabaha Contract;\n\n(c)        you authorise the Security Trustee to act as trustee for you and on your behalf for the purpose of the trust arrangement specified in Clause 5.9(b) and the perpetuity period of that trust shall be 125 years;\n\n(d)        you shall enter into, and procure the entry into by any necessary third party, the Security Documents.\n\n5.10        If within the period specified in the Finance Request your Finance Request receives Offers that equal the total amount you are seeking to borrow, then within a further 5 Business Days you must either:\n\n(a)        accept each of the Offers (including any subsequent Offers by Investors agreeing to novation) by:\n\n(i)         satisfying the Special Conditions; and\n\n(ii)        entering into and returning the duly executed Security Documents to the Security Trustee;\n\n(iii)       entering into the Murabaha Contracts in accordance with the electronic signing instructions on the Service, which shall also constitute your irrevocable continuing agreement to the novation of any such Murabaha Contracts by the relevant Investors (and each subsequent novation of such novated Murabaha Contracts) as often as the relevant Investors agree in accordance with these Service Terms; or\n\n(b)        notify us that you decline to accept the Offers.\n\n5.11        You acknowledge and agree that you are solely responsible and liable for:\n\n(a)        the statements made by you in relation to your Finance Request(s);\n\n(b)        obtaining your own independent financial, legal, environmental, accounting, tax advice and any other professional advice you require in relation to your Finance Request, the Due Diligence, the Murabaha Contracts (including the Murabaha Conditions) and the Security Documents.\n\n5.12        By submitting any Information to us or Investors via the Service, you warrant and represent to us and each Investor that:\n\n(a)        any statements made by you as a Buyer have the approval of your board of directors and that you have taken all appropriate legal, tax and accounting advice;\n\n(b)        any statements you make are complete, clear, fair and not misleading; and\n\n(c)        any projections or forward-looking statements which you make are reasonable and can be supported by evidence.\n\n5.13        You acknowledge and agree that neither we nor the Security Trustee:\n\n(a)        will verify or audit statements made by you in relation to any Finance Requests, for which the Buyer is solely and exclusively responsible;\n\n(b)        will supply you with any financial, legal, accounting or tax advice; and\n\n(c)        warrants or represents that use of any of the documents supplied as part of the Service is or are suitable or appropriate for your needs and you must take your own independent legal and other advice on the terms of such documents.\n\n5.14        We shall have no duty to disclose to you any Information which we receive in the course of providing the Service or other services to other persons including, without limitation to the generality of the foregoing, to any Buyer or Investor or potential Buyer or potential Investor.\n\n6.  After the Murabaha Contract is formed\n6.1          Subject always to our right to reject a Finance Request, upon a Finance Request achieving the required funding amount and acceptance under Clause 5.10(a) and the provisions in each Murabaha Contract concerning disbursement:\n\n(a)        we will provide to the Buyer a Murabaha Contract Summary and agree the amount of any Fees owed by the Buyer under Clause 11 of these Service Terms or the Murabaha Contract Summary (together, “Fees”) and any amount(s) due to any relevant third party by the Buyer;\n\n(b)        we will debit the Offer Amount from each Investor’s Nester Account and credit the Buyer’s Nester Account for that amount, less:\n\n(i)         the amount of any Fees owed by the Buyer; and\n\n(ii)        any amount(s) due to any third party by the Buyer;\n\n(c)        each Investor hereby authorises us, and we undertake, to instruct the Payment Agent to deduct and pay from their Payment Account or their IFISA Account (as appropriate) to either:\n\n(i)        the trust account of the solicitors acting for Nester Security Trustee Ltd on behalf of the Investor, where the funds will be held pending execution of the Security Documents after which we undertake to instruct Nester Security Trustee Ltd to instruct the solicitor to transfer the funds to the Buyer’s solicitor or such other payee nominated by the Buyer or the Buyer’s solicitor; or\n\n(ii)        as may otherwise stipulated in the Murabaha Contract, net of any amounts payable by the Buyer under Clause 6.1(b) which you hereby authorise us, and we undertake, to instruct the Payment Agent to deduct and pay to us or the relevant third party.\n\n6.2          For administrative convenience, each Buyer shall pay each of the Murabaha Instalments under all the Murabaha Contracts entered into at or about the same time in a single payment specified in the Murabaha Contract Summary to their Payment Account. Each Buyer hereby authorises us, and we undertake, to instruct the Payment Agent to distribute each Murabaha Instalment from the Buyer’s Payment Account to each of the Investors under whose Murabaha Contracts a relevant Murabaha Instalment is due and to pay us or any third party any amounts specified in the Murabaha Contract as being payable by the Buyer to us or any such third party from that Murabaha Instalment. We also undertake to record the payment of those Murabaha Instalments in the Nester Account of each Investor and Buyer when informed of their processing by the Payment Agent. Profit due under each Murabaha Contract will be paid gross to the relevant Investors, and each Investor shall be responsible for accounting for and paying any taxes due on such profit\n\n6.3          If the Buyer misses a payment or only partially pays the amount due to you as the Investor, you authorise us or a collections agency nominated by us and whose details we provide to you in writing (“the Collections Agency”), acting on your behalf, (and we undertake to, or direct the Collections Agency on your behalf to, as the case may be) take steps to procure the payment of an amount equivalent to the outstanding payment and any additional fees and charges due under the relevant Murabaha Contract.\n\n6.4          We will keep Investors informed of the progress of the attempts to collect the outstanding payment(s).\n\n6.5          In the event of the occurrence of any Event of Default (as defined in the Murabaha Conditions) the Security Trustee shall enforce all or any of the Security Documents and the relevant proportion of any sums recovered by the Security Trustee will be paid to each eligible Investor, subject to deduction of the costs of recovery (including legal fees and expenses and those of any manager, receiver or administrator appointed by the Security Trustee) from the gross proceeds recovered, such that the net amount recovered shall be apportioned according to the proportion that the Outstanding Amount (as defined in each Murabaha Contract) under each of your Murabaha Contracts represented to the total amount of finance obtained by the Buyer under all such Murabaha Contracts (“Total Outstanding Amount”), as shown in the relevant Murabaha Contract Summary. The Security Trustee will keep each Investor informed of the progress in enforcing the Security Document(s) concerned.\n\n6.6          As an Investor, you acknowledge the possibility that the proceeds recovered (if any) as a result of any recovery and enforcement activity may not be sufficient to discharge all the relevant Buyer’s obligations to you. In that case, you will only be entitled to recover a share of any recovery proceeds, subject to deduction of the costs of recovery (including legal fees and expenses and those of any manager, receiver or administrator appointed by the Security Trustee) from the gross proceeds recovered, such that the net amount recovered shall be apportioned according to the proportion that the Murabaha Price, less Operating Fee (as defined in each Murabaha Contract) under each of your eligible Murabaha Contracts represented to the Total Outstanding Amount.\n\nNovation of Murabaha Contracts\n \n\n6.7          As the Investor under an existing Murabaha Contract, you may effectively sell your interests by way of novation on any Payment Date specified in the Murabaha Contract (“Payment Date”). Novation is a means of transfer that cancels the Outgoing Investor’s rights and obligations under the Murabaha Contract that is being novated (“Prior Murabaha Contract”), as well as the Outgoing Investor’s related rights and obligations in the Service Terms and the Security Documents; and creates a new Murabaha Contract between the Buyer and the new Investor, who pays the Outgoing Investor the outstanding Murabaha Price in accordance with Clause 6.8. In this way, the new Murabaha Contract replaces the Prior Murabaha Contract, in return for the new Investor assuming identical rights and obligations under the new Murabaha Contract to those of the Outgoing Investor under the Prior Murabaha Contract. The Buyer agrees in advance to each novation of the Buyer’s Murabaha Contracts under Clause 5.10(a), but none of the terms of the Murabaha Contract(s), these Service Terms or Security Documents is changed by the novation process.\n6.8          As the Investor under an existing Murabaha Contract, you may initiate the novation process referred to in Clause 6.7 by specifying in your Nester Account the Murabaha Contract(s) that you wish to novate, in which case you hereby irrevocably offer to cancel all your rights and obligations under the Murabaha Contract, as well as your related rights and obligations under these Service Terms and Security Documents in relation to that Murabaha Contract, on the next Payment Date in return for another Investor assuming identical rights and obligations under a new Murabaha Contract with the relevant Buyer and paying to you the outstanding Murabaha Price accrued but not paid as at the date of novation.\n(6.9)        Where any Murabaha Contract that you offer to novate under Clause 6.8 (“Prior Murabaha Contract”) matches the criteria of any Offer made by an Investor with sufficient funds under Clause 4 (“New Investor”), you (as “the Outgoing Investor”) hereby accept such Offer and agree to the novation of the Prior Murabaha Contract on the next Payment Date, such that:\n(a)        your rights and obligations under the Prior Murabaha Contract (as well as your related rights and obligations in these Service Terms and the Security Documents) are cancelled;\n\n(b)        the New Investor assumes identical rights and obligations under a new Murabaha Contract to the rights and obligations of the Outgoing Investor under the Prior Murabaha Contract, with the Buyer’s consent under Clause 5.10(a) (“New Murabaha Contract”);\n\n(c)        the New Murabaha Contract replaces the Prior Murabaha Contract;\n\n(d)        the New Investor pays the outstanding Murabaha Price to the Outgoing Investor as a result of us recording a debit for the amount of the outstanding Murabaha Price from the Nester Account of the New Investor and a credit for that amount to your Nester Account, less the amount of the outstanding Murabaha Fee payable under Clause 11.3; and\n\n(e)        we record the details of the novation in the Nester Account of the Buyer and each of the relevant Investors.\n\n6.10         Following each novation pursuant to Clauses 6.8 and 6.9 of these Service Terms:\n(a)        The Outgoing Investor shall remain liable for, and indemnifies and holds harmless the New Investor from and against any loss, liability, claim, demand, damages, costs and expenses (including reasonable legal fees and expenses) arising out of or in connection with the Prior Murabaha Contract; and\n\n(b)        The New Investor shall be and remain liable for, and indemnifies and holds harmless the Outgoing Investor from and against any loss, liability, claim, demand, damages, costs and expenses (including reasonable legal fees and expenses) arising out of or in connection with the New Investor’s Murabaha Contract with the relevant Buyer.\n\n7.   Your money\n7.1          Money in your IFISA Account and your Payment Account(s) will be held separately from the IFISA Manager and Payment Service Provider’s own money in accordance and they will exercise due skill, care and diligence in the selection, appointment and periodic review of any credit institution or bank where your money is deposited and for the arrangements for holding your money, but neither we nor they shall be otherwise responsible for any acts, omissions or default of any such credit institution or bank.\n\n7.2          Transfers into your Payment Account(s) and/or your IFISA Account must be made by electronic transfer from your Nominated Payment Account. Withdrawals from your Payment Account(s) and/or your IFISA Account will only be made to your Nominated Payment Account.\n\n7.3          You authorise Nester to instruct the Payment Agent or Payment Service Provider to transfer any money it holds for you in the Payment Account(s) and/or the IFISA Manager to transfer any money that it holds for you in the IFISA Account to a replacement payment service provider or IFISA manager (as the case may be) without seeking your express instruction to do so, provided the new payment service provider or IFISA manager has the appropriate regulatory permissions.\n\n7.3          No interest is payable on money held in your Payment Account(s) or IFISA Account and no fees are charged in respect of establishing the accounts.\n\n7.4          No interest is payable on money held in your Payment Account(s) or IFISA Account and no fees are charged in respect of establishing the accounts.\n\n7.5          By accepting these Service Terms, you appoint the IFISA Manager to hold any monies paid into your IFISA Account, including funds deposited by you to fund Murabaha Contracts and any money paid to you by Buyers.\n\n7.6          The IFISA Manager will treat you as its client and will treat money in your IFISA Account as “Client Money”, which will be held in an approved bank account in accordance with the FCA's client money rules. The IFISA Manager will use reasonable skill and care for the selection, use and monitoring of any approved bank with which Client Money is held, but will not be liable for their acts or their insolvency.\n\n7.7          Any Client Money will be held in a pooled account and will not be separately identifiable from Client Money of other clients of the IFISA Manager or its associates on the relevant bank’s books and records. Accordingly, should the IFISA Manager default on its obligations to its clients, any shortfall in Client Money held by the relevant bank may be shared pro-rata among all clients whose money is held in the pooled client money account.\n\n7.8          If a bank with which the IFISA Manager holds Client Money fails (including the appointment of a liquidator, receiver, administrator, or trustee in bankruptcy, or any equivalent), this will constitute a secondary pooling event under the FCA Rules, which may result in a shortfall in the funds held for you. The maximum compensation available from the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS) in respect of money held in a bank account is £85,000.\n\n7.9          In the event of our insolvency, the IFISA Manager will continue to hold your money, but will not facilitate the funding of any new loans. The IFISA Manager will notify you of changes to reporting requirements in such an event.\n\n7.10          In the event of the IFISA Manager’s insolvency, we will attempt to find an alternative services provider to enable the Services to continue to be delivered.\n\n7.11          If we or the IFISA Manager become insolvent and owe you money in respect of the regulated services we have provided to you at the time of our insolvency, you may be entitled to compensation from the FSCS, up to a maximum of £85,000. For more information you can contact the FSCS in writing at 7th Floor, Lloyds Chambers, Portsoken Street, London, E1 8BN by telephone on 0800 678 1100, by email to enquiries@fscs.org.uk or by going to www.fscs.org.uk.\n\n7.12          If a Client Money balance remains unclaimed and there has been no movement on the balance for a period of at least six years (ignoring any payments or receipts of charges, interest or similar items), provided the IFISA Manager has taken reasonable steps to trace the client and return the balance, the IFISA Manager may cease to treat the money as Client Money and pay the Client Money to a registered charity of the IFISA Manager's choice.\n\n7.13          You hereby authorise Nester to instruct the Payment Service Provider, Payment Agent and/or IFISA Manager to deduct and pay from your Payment Account or your IFISA Account to your Nominated Payment Account or the relevant Buyer’s or other Investor’s Payment Account (or as otherwise stipulated in the Murabaha Contract) the funds that are due and payable to that Buyer or Investor, as the case may be, under or in relation to any relevant Murabaha Contract, net of any amounts payable to us or any third party, which you hereby authorise us to instruct the Payment Service Provider, Payment Agent or IFISA Manager to deduct and pay to us or the relevant third party, as the case may be.\n\n8.  Opening a Nester IFISA\n8.1          If you apply for a Nester IFISA, the IFISA Manager undertakes to:\n\n(a)          treat you as its client;\n\n(b)          receive payments in respect of your Murabaha Contracts and credit those payments to your IFISA Account; and\n\n(c)          exercise, or facilitate the exercise of, your rights in respect of any Murabaha Contracts held in your Nester IFISA if necessary,and you appoint the IFISA Manager as your agent to do anything required on your behalf to enable it to fulfil those undertakings.\n\n8.2          In normal circumstances, the IFISA Manager does not charge any fees to you for opening and operating your IFISA Account, however if we do not pay fees due to the IFISA Manager and you require the continued provision of the ISA management services, you agree to pay the IFISA Manager’s fees and charges and consent to the IFISA Manager deducting amounts from your IFISA Account for the purposes of paying such fees.\n\n8.3          The management of your IFISA Account will be subject to the means the Individual Savings Account Regulations 1998 (as amended or replaced from time to time) (the “ISA Regulations”).\n\n8.4          Any changes made by HMRC to the ISA Regulations that affect these Service Terms will apply as soon as they come into effect.\n\n8.5          The IFISA Manager will notify you, if by reason of any failure to satisfy the provisions of the ISA Regulations, all or part of your IFISA has or will become invalid. If the failure can be corrected, the IFISA Manager will repair your IFISA.\n\n8.6          You may subscribe to a Nester IFISA in any tax year (i.e. period starting on 6 April of one year and ending 5 April of the following year) for which you are either resident and ordinarily resident in the United Kingdom; or, although non-resident in the United Kingdom, perform duties of a Crown employee which are treated as being performed in the United Kingdom, or are the spouse or civil partner of such a person.\n\n8.7          You must inform the IFISA Manager immediately if you are no longer a UK resident or cease to perform duties of a Crown employee which are treated as being performed in the United Kingdom, or cease to be the spouse or civil partner of such a person.\n\n8.8          When you open an IFISA Account, the IFISA Manager will ask you to make a declaration. Making this declaration will allow you to subscribe for a Nester IFISA in the tax year that you make the declaration and for each subsequent tax year, provided you make a subscription to your Nester IFISA every tax year. If you do not make a subscription to your Nester IFISA one year, then when you next want to subscribe to your Nester IFISA you will have to make a new declaration.\n\n8.9          You must inform the IFISA Manager if any declarations or confirmations you have made about your eligibility to hold a Nester IFISA no longer apply.\n\n8.10          In accordance with the ISA Regulations, you are not eligible to apply if you have already subscribed to another IFISA in the same tax year, or if you have already subscribed the maximum available allowance to a Cash ISA and/or Stocks and Shares ISA, in the same tax year as you are applying for this Nester IFISA. These restrictions do not apply if you are:\n\n(a)          transferring an existing IFISA from another ISA provider to the Nester IFISA (in circumstances where this is permitted under the ISA Regulations), or\n\n(b)          where you have already subscribed the maximum allowance to a cash and/or stocks and shares ISA and this is transferred to this Nester IFISA.\n\n8.11          All subscriptions to your Nester IFISA must be in cash. You can transfer cash held in your Payment Account to your IFISA Account, but you cannot transfer Murabaha Contracts which have already been funded.\n\n8.12          If funds are subscribed into your IFISA Account which exceed the amount prescribed in the ISA Regulations, then the excess subscription will be transferred to your Payment Account.\n\n8.13          Your Nester IFISA will be flexible as defined in the ISA Regulations. This flexibility means cash which is withdrawn can be replaced, in whole or part, within the same tax year and this will not affect your ISA subscription limit for that year.\n\n8.14          If you have any questions, doubts or issues relating to ISAs or your eligibility to hold a Nester IFISA, you should consult the HMRC website (https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs) or contact them directly.\n\n8.15          Any notifications to the IFISA Manager should be made by emailing Nester at ISAsupport@nester.com, who will then pass on your communication to the IFISA Manager. Similarly, any communications to you from the IFISA Manager will be made through Nester.\n\n9  Transfers in and out of your Nester IFISA\n9.1          You may transfer money into your Nester IFISA from an existing ISA with another provider, in cash only. An online transfer-in form will need to be completed and then the IFISA Manager will make a transfer authority form available for you to approve and sign. The IFISA Manager can then arrange for the funds to be transferred from your existing ISA provider in accordance with your instructions.\n\n9.2          The transfer-in process will begin on the date on the transfer authority form or the date you stipulate for the IFISA Manager to begin the transfer process, whichever is later. The IFISA Manager will then send your request for the transfer to your existing ISA Provider within five business days of receiving your transfer authority form.\n\n9.3          You may transfer any cash in your current year’s ISA subscriptions in whole, and/or you can transfer previous years subscriptions in whole or in part (together with interest) to another ISA provider in accordance with the ISA Regulations and these conditions. You will need to contact your other ISA provider to arrange the transfer and you can choose the date funds are transferred, subject to the IFISA Manager being allowed a reasonable period to implement it.\n\n10.  CANCELLATION OR CLOSURE OF YOUR IFISA ACCOUNT\n10.1          You have the right to cancel your Nester IFISA within 14 calendar days of the date your IFISA Account is opened. You can do this by emailing ISAsupport@nester.com or by phoning 0203 983 0707.\n\n10.2          If your Nester IFISA is cancelled, unless you provide us and the IFISA Manager with specific instructions, we will transfer any Murabaha Contracts recorded in your Nester IFISA to your Nester Account and the IFISA Manager will transfer any money credited to your IFISA Account to your Payment Account and you will lose the tax benefits associated with an IFISA.\n\n10.3          After the 14-day cancellation period, you can choose to close your Nester IFISA at any time, provided you only have cash in the IFISA Account. If you do not arrange with another ISA provider to transfer the money in your IFISA Account to them, you will not be able to subscribe to another IFISA with another ISA provider in the same tax year.\n\n10.4          The IFISA Manager may close your Nester IFISA with immediate written notice to you if directed to do so by HM Revenue & Customs. You agree to reimburse the IFISA Manager for any administrative fees, charges from HMRC or any tax authority incurred as a result of your failure to comply with ISA Regulations.\n\n10.5          If the IFISA Manager or you close your Nester IFISA and do not receive alternative transfer instructions from you within 1 month of trying to contact you, any Murabaha Contracts recorded in your Nester IFISA will be transferred to your Nester Account and money credited to your IFISA Account will be transferred to your Payment Account.\n\n10.6          If the IFISA Manager receives notification of your death, the IFISA Manager will suspend all transactions and investments in your Nester IFISA. ISA tax exemptions will no longer apply from the date of death, and any gains that arise after the date of death will not be exempt from tax.\n\n10.7          Your Nester IFISA will be valued for probate as at the date of death and dealt with as instructed by your executors.
